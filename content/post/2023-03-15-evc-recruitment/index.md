title: 'Olin College Research Study: Data Science for Engineers'
---

Are you interested in learning how to use data science in your engineering work? Are you a practicing engineer? You might be interested in this opportunity!

This summer (June of 2023) I am running a study of practicing engineers. This study includes a *free* 2-day professional development workshop on data science in engineering. This workshop is designed for engineers with a background in structural engineering, such as mechanical, civil, aerospace, and related disciplines.

The workshop will cover:

- Visualizing data to gain insights
- Making messy data usable for analysis
- An intuitive, hands-on treatment of statistics

The course is designed to be compatible with full-time employment (taught online, outside working hours), will consist of hands-on training with computational tools, and will include live instruction with a professor from Olin College.

While participation in the study is free, space is limited. If you are interested in the study, please fill out this application:

If you are selected for the study, we will contact you at your provided email address with more information. If you would like more information about study, please contact me. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in learning more about this Human Research Protection Program determined exempt project. This work is supported by the NSF under Grant Number 2138463.

Warm regards,

Zachary del Rosario, Assistant Professor, Olin College
