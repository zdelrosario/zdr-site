title: 'November Cambridge Cheminformatics Talk'
---

I was invited to give a talk at the November [Cambridge Cheminformatics](http://www.c-inf.net/) meeting. There I discussed lessons learned from my [Assessing the Frontier]({{< ref "publication/map-jcp" >}}) paper; namely, the *unsuitability* of traditional model accuracy metrics for judging the efficacy of ML for materials discovery. Links to [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mcyk2NdUWaHkn1dOnq1DN_u2dxjVKQaP/view?usp=sharing) and a [video recording](https://youtu.be/2OU1j2EY8M0) are both available.
