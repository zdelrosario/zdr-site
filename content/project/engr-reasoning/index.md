# Project Description

The aim of this project is to understand practicing engineersâ€™ capability to handle variability, and to develop engineering pedagogy to teach this skill. This work is inspired by a key finding: Every aircraft you have ever flown on has been designed using probabilistically-flawed, potentially dangerous criteria. This was a core finding of my PhD thesis work; additional archival research has revealed that these criteria have been in use since at least 1964, but their limitations and dangers were only documented in 2020. The core issue is simple: Aerospace engineers summarize variable material properties using conservative estimates for strength properties (a one-sided tolerance interval), but use a measure of central tendency (e.g. the mean) for material moduli such as material elasticity. This approach neglects variability from elastic properties, which is dangerous for laminate composites (e.g. carbon fiber): laminate static failure criteria are affected by elastic properties, and those properties have variabilities 2x to 6x that of traditional metallic materials. For failure modes involving modulus properties (e.g. buckling, dominant for wing top skin panels), the old criteria, while safe for metals, are now unsafe for highly variable composites.
