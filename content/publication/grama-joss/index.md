abstract: Grama is a Python package implementing a functional grammar of model analysis emphasizing the quantification of uncertainties. In Grama a model contains both a function mapping inputs to outputs as well as a distribution characterizing uncertainties on those inputs. This conceptual object unifies the engineer/scientistâ€™s definition of a model with that of a statistician. Grama provides an implementation of this model concept, as well as verbs to carry out model-building and model-analysis.

summary: Peforming model analysis under uncertainty is uncommon and challenging. I developed Grama to make uncertainty quantification easier to teach and to communicate.
