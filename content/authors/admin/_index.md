Zachary del Rosario is an Assistant Professor of Engineering and Applied Statistics at Olin College. He studies how people react to uncertainty. In particular, he is interested in how technical people (scientists, engineers) make decisions with numbers. There are examples in the historical record where decisions ignored uncertainty and the results led to catastrophic failure. Prof. del Rosario's research goals are to understand how technical people experience uncertainty, and use that understanding to help them make better decisions.
